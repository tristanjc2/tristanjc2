<details> <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
      My passion for Web Development ignited during my teenage years while attempting to create RuneScape private servers. Despite initial struggles with Java, I found my forte in Front-End development, excelling in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've expanded my skills with React and Django, and I'm steadily advancing in Python, with aspirations to explore C++ or Rust. Having completed around 10 Professional Certificates, including three courses at MIT, I'm currently pursuing a degree in Science and Computer Information Systems at the University of Maine Augusta. Proficient in Linux, I favor Ubuntu as my daily driver, having also explored Kali and HTB. My overarching goal is to create impactful projects, showcasing that perseverance can overcome life's challenges.
