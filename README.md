<details> <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
      I developed interest in Web Development when I was very young. I got into the idea of coding when I was a teenager trying to create my own RuneScape private servers. Through constant failure to learn Java efficently, I made my way back to Front-End development. Where I excel. I enjoy HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have more recently been learning React and Django. I also have been learning Python steadily and would like to eventually learn C++ or Rust. I have finished roughly 10 Professional Certificate's. Most of which through Coursera. I am enrolled through the University of Maine Augusta persuing a degree in Science and Computer Information Systems. Recently completed three courses with different groups at MIT. I am proficent with Linux, I enjoy Ubuntu for a daily driver and I have dabbled with Kali and HTB. I hope to make great things one day and show everyone that against all odds you can succeed no matter what life throws at you.
